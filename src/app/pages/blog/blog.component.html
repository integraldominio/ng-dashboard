        <p>Angular Ivy change detection execution: are you prepared?</p>
        <p>Let’s see what Angular cooks for us</p>
        <p>While new Ivy renderer is not feature completely yet, many people wonder how it will work and what changes it prepares
            for us.
        </p>
        <p>In this article I am going to visualize Ivy change detection mechanism, show some things I am really excited about
            and also build simple app based on instructions, similar to angular Ivy instructions, from scratch.</p>

        <p>If you didn’t dive deep into angular dependency injection mechanism, your mental model should be that in angular
            application we have some root injector with all merged providers, every component has its own injector and lazy
            loaded module introduces new injector.</p>
        <p>But maybe there is some more you should be aware of?

        </p>
        <p>Also a while ago, so-called Tree-Shakeable Tokens feature was merged into master branch. If you are like me, you
            probably want to know what has changed.</p>
        <p>So it’s time to examine all these things and maybe find something new...
